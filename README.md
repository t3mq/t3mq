### <samp>&gt; Hi there, I'm T3mq ! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25"> </samp>

### Nice to see you here ! &nbsp;

I'm the developer of [**DropRadar**][DropRadar], A bot that lets you buy shoes online based on [Discord](https://discord.com).

I love spending my time creating something that not only looks good but also perfectly usable and practical. I decided to create DropRadar in 2024 because more and more people are interested in the world of sneakers, especially in famous pairs like travis and others!

If you want to support me, you can <a href="https://ko-fi.com/t3mq_"> buy me a coffee</a>
